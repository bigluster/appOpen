# appOpen
Provides a dropdown list to open Qlik Sense Applications in your deployment.

Uses the Qlik Sense Mashup API to obtain a list of apps.
Uses jqueryui to create the dropdown list.  

The dropdown list overflows over other objects, therefore, minimal vertical space required when adding extension to the canvas.

This visualization extension uses api calls and methods from Qlik Sense 2.0.2 extension and mashup apis.
